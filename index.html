    <p>
      Pat Doe, Seattle native, grew up enamoured with both seafood and baking. His father, a fishermen, taught him how to appreciate salmon from a young age. Meanwhile, his mother, a classically trained pasty chef, instilled within him a love for baking. Upon realizing he could combine these two passions of his, a new company was formed -- Pat's Salmon Cookies, a place where seafood and baking combine in harmony. Pat is best known for his salmon cookies -- delicious  salmon-shaped cookies with actual ground up salmon in them! As all those who have tried his delicious baked goods have said, "they're suprisingly delicious"
